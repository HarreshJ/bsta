            <h1 class="headline">History of Brooklyn</h1>
            <ul class="brooklyn_history" class="brooklyn_history_box">
                <li>From the 17th century, Brooklyn started as an agricultural land before developing into an important urban center by the 19th century.</li>
                <br />
                <li>The Brooklyn Bridge completion in 1883 was a monumental achievement because it enabled more convenient transport from Brooklyn to Manhattan.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Prospect Park (est.1867) and designed by the same architect as the one who designed Central Park, quickly became a shared common gathering spot and a nice area to hang around with friends. It includes a large lake (with turtles) and many events like a concert area and ice-skating rink.</li>
                <br />
                <li>The Brooklyn Dodgers (Brooklyn's baseball team) were a beloved part of the city until they relocated to LA in '57.</li>
                <br />
                <li>2012 was a huge sporting turnaround for Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Nets (often condensed to the Nets) moved from New Jersey to Brooklyn, which invoked a new sense of achievement and pride in the locals who found a renewed ambition for sport.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Nowadays, Brooklyn is a popular location for its diversity, variety of food and "hipster" culture.</li>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Navigation</strong> - Being able to travel around is essential and what better way to try leading the navigation on trips in a foreign country right! Adapting to the new subway system in NY compared to the one in London helped me to think quicker and more logically (somehow) because I had to quickly find the route and get on the right train to get to places on time.</td>
                <td><strong>Python</strong> - Although we learnt the basics in school I managed to learn more on this trip - especially focusing on classes and objects and learnt how to make games with added functionality - i.e. instead of moving left and right, I could enable the robot to jump and turn and let the grid be an adjustable size depending on input without changing the game at all.</td>

    <section>
        <h2 class="skills">Extra Information gathered</h2>
        <ul class="extraInfo">
            <li>At the startup there were much fewer employees (evidently) and less people were working onsite - most worked remotely. They had to hire more private contractors to help with the code mainly because they only had two main software engineers - one for the frontend and one for the backend.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Whereas in a bigger company like Google the building was evidently much larger and nicer with many more benefits (i.e. free food, massages, game rooms...etc) and while the teams were around the same size as those in the startup, there were a few hundred more, so while any work contributed was definitely worthwhile - it could be estimated that the work in the startup had a much larger initial impact.</li>

            <li><strong>Ah c’est drôle, j’savais pas</strong> = Ah, that's funny, I didn't know that</li>
